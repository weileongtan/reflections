When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local? 
	
	when you need a remote backup and when you need to collaborate

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	network connectivity + you don't want the ground changing under you without you knowing it

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks - splitting off from something you don't control
	branch - splitting off from something you do control
	clones - making a manually-controlled mirror

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	you have a fixed basis from which to work off instead of it slipstream-updating while you work.  that way any parallel commits made to it while you're offline you can compare line by line if necessary.
