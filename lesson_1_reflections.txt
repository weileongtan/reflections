How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	direct visual comparison

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    keep track of every change made a long time ago

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    sometimes you know something is temporary so it doesn't need to be committed vs. you forget to commit after important changes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    geared towards different purposes.  Google Docs basically expects everything you do to be in one file; coding isn't necessarily like this.    

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    'git log' to see the commit messages, then 'git diff --stat' to see the statistics of changes and not the specific changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can always undo the damage

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    change the world
